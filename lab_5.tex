\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this two-weeks lab is to characterise the LIV (Light, Current, Voltage) properties of a red laser and multiple different colours of LEDs. For that we will use the current source built in Lab 2 and the photoreceiver that converts light into voltage from Lab 4. Prior to this lab a laser safety lecture has been given to manipulate the laser used in this lab safely.

\section{Pre - Lab}
Laser informations from the spec sheet:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\lambda$ = $650~\mathrm{nm}$
    \item P = $5~\mathrm{mW}$, here we will take P = $7~\mathrm{mW}$ to ensure the validity of our calculations
    \item Divergences angles: $\theta_{\parallel } = 6 ^{\circ} = 0.104 ~\mathrm{rad}$ and $\theta_{\perp } = 24^{\circ} = 0.409~\mathrm{rad}$
\end{itemize}

\[
MPE = 18\times t^{0.75} ~\mathrm{Jm^{-2}}
\]
\[
MPE = 18\times 0.25^{0.75}  = 6.36 ~\mathrm{Jm^{-2}}
\]

MPE = 25.5 ~\mathrm{Wm^{-2}}
\]
\subsubsection*{AEL}
\[
AEL = MPE \times Area 
\]
\[
AEL = 25.5 \pi \left( \frac{0.007}{2} \right)^{2} \approx 1~\mathrm{mW}
\]
\subsubsection*{NOHD}
\[
NOHD = 2 \sqrt{\frac{P}{MPE\times\pi\left(\theta\right)^{2}}}
\]
\[
NOHD = 2 \sqrt{\frac{7\times10^{-3}}{\left(25.5\right)\times\pi\left(0.419\right)\left(0.104\right)}} \approx 0.09~\mathrm{m}
\]

\]
\subsubsection*{AEL}
\[
AEL = MPE \times Area 
\]
\[
AEL = 10 \pi \left( \frac{0.007}{2} \right)^{2} \approx 4 \times 10^{-4}~\mathrm{W}
\]
\subsubsection*{NOHD}
\[
NOHD = 2 \sqrt{\frac{P}{MPE\times\pi\left(\theta\right)^{2}}}
\]
\[

\]

\subsection{Current range}

From the spec sheet, the current range for the AlGnInP laser is $0\mathrm{mA} \geq I \geq 35 \mathrm{mA}$. For relevance, the same current range will be used for LEDs.

\subsection{Design of the circuits}
For this circuit, the OpAmp MCP601 has been used and it has been powered up with a dual power supply of $+5V$ and $0V$. The diagram of the circuit is shown below:

\end{figure}
The value of the feedback resistor $R_{f}$ is chosen to be $26.7\mathrm{k\Omega}$  and the protection resistance is $R_{p} = 2.17\mathrm{k\Omega}$. For the resistance used in the 2 and 4 wire circuit, their values is $R = 2.2\mathrm{k\Omega}$.

\section{Lab results}
The pictures of the experimental setup can be found below:

    \caption{Circuit setup}
    \label{fig:setup}
\end{figure}
A different photodiode then the SFH 203 P has been used for data collection of the laser.\\
To calculate the optical power, the following formula has been used:
\[
P = \frac{V_{out}}{G \times R_{\lambda}}
\]
Where $V_{out}$ is the output voltage of the photoreceiver circuit, $G$ is the transimpedance gain in $\mathrm{V/A}$, $R_{\lambda}$ is photodiode responsivity in $\mathrm{V/A}$ at laser wavelength. For the red laser at $650\mathrm{nm}$, $R_{\lambda} = 0.4 \mathrm{A/W}$. 
\subsection{IV characterisation}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Observations}

Figure~\ref{fig:red.combined} shows that the resistance of the amber LED depends on the current. According to Figure~\ref{fig:red.3}, the 2-wire slope is $V = 0.0193 (I) + 1.895$, while the 4-wire slope is $V = 0.0146 (I) + 1.885$. The resistance can be extracted from the slope as $R = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta I}$. Therefore, the resistance for the 2-wire measurement is $R_{2-wire} = 19.3 \mathrm{\Omega}$ and for the 4-wire measurement is $R_{4-wire} = 14.6 \mathrm{\Omega}$. The internal resistance of the circuit can be calculated as $R_{circuit} = R_{2-wire} - R_{4-wire} = 4.6 \mathrm{\Omega}$. The internal resistance of the circuit is responsible for the difference in slopes, where the lead resistance and contact resistances are significantly affecting the 2-wire results.

Figure~\ref{fig:red.4} shows how the voltage drops across the resistors in the circuit.

\subsubsection{Amber LED}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Observations}

Figure~\ref{fig:amber.combined} shows that the resistance of the amber LED depends on the current. According to Figure~\ref{fig:amber.3}, the 2-wire slope is $V = 0.0077 (I) + 1.910$, while the 4-wire slope is $V = 0.0030 (I) + 1.901$. The resistance can be extracted from the slope as $R = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta I}$. Therefore, the resistance for the 2-wire measurement is $R_{2-wire} = 7.7 \mathrm{\Omega}$ and for the 4-wire measurement is $R_{4-wire} = 3.0 \mathrm{\Omega}$. The internal resistance of the circuit can be calculated as $R_{circuit} = R_{2-wire} - R_{4-wire} = 4.3 \mathrm{\Omega}$. The internal resistance of the circuit is responsible for the difference in slopes, where the lead resistance and contact resistances are significantly affecting the 2-wire results.

Figure~\ref{fig:green.combined} shows that the resistance of the green LED depends on the current. According to Figure~\ref{fig:green.3}, the 2-wire slope is $V = 0.0229 (I) + 1.946$, while the 4-wire slope is $V = 0.0181 (I) + 1.937$. The resistance can be extracted from the slope as $R = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta I}$. Therefore, the resistance for the 2-wire measurement is $R_{2-wire} = 22.9 \mathrm{\Omega}$ and for the 4-wire measurement is $R_{4-wire} = 18.1 \mathrm{\Omega}$. The internal resistance of the circuit can be calculated as $R_{circuit} = R_{2-wire} - R_{4-wire} = 4.8 \mathrm{\Omega}$. The internal resistance of the circuit is responsible for the difference in slopes, where the lead resistance and contact resistances are significantly affecting the 2-wire results.

Figure~\ref{fig:green.4} shows how the voltage drops across the resistors in the circuit.

\subsubsection*{Observations}

Figure~\ref{fig:blue.combined} shows that the resistance of the blue LED depends on the current. According to Figure~\ref{fig:blue.3}, the 2-wire slope is $V = 0.0091 (I) + 3.037$, while the 4-wire slope is $V = 0.0104 (I) + 2.912$. The resistance can be extracted from the slope as $R = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta I}$. Therefore, the resistance for the 2-wire measurement is $R_{2-wire} = 9.1 \mathrm{\Omega}$ and for the 4-wire measurement is $R_{4-wire} = 10.4 \mathrm{\Omega}$. The internal resistance of the circuit can be calculated as $R_{circuit} = R_{2-wire} - R_{4-wire} = -0.9 \mathrm{\Omega}$. The internal resistance of the circuit is negative, which is not physically possible. This discrepancy may be due to measurement errors or variations in the LED's characteristics. The internal resistance of the circuit is responsible for the difference in slopes, where the lead resistance and contact resistances are significantly affecting the 2-wire results.

Figure~\ref{fig:laser.combined} shows that the resistance of the laser depends on the current. According to Figure~\ref{fig:laser.3}, the 2-wire slope is $V = 0.0135 (I) + 1.953$, while the 4-wire slope is $V = 0.0088 (I) + 1.943$. The resistance can be extracted from the slope as $R = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta I}$. Therefore, the resistance for the 2-wire measurement is $R_{2-wire} = 13.5 \mathrm{\Omega}$ and for the 4-wire measurement is $R_{4-wire} = 8.8 \mathrm{\Omega}$. The internal resistance of the circuit can be calculated as $R_{circuit} = R_{2-wire} - R_{4-wire} = 4.7 \mathrm{\Omega}$. The internal resistance of the circuit is responsible for the difference in slopes, where the lead resistance and contact resistances are significantly affecting the 2-wire results.

\subsection{Conclusion}

In this lab, we characterised the LIV properties of a red laser and multiple different colours of LEDs using a current source and a photoreceiver. The internal resistances of the circuit and each device were calculated, revealing variations between devices. The blue LED exhibited a negative internal resistance, likely due to measurement errors. Overall, the lab provided insights into the electrical and optical characteristics of these devices.

E_c(\mathbf{k}) \approx E_{c0} + \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_e^*}, \qquad
E_v(\mathbf{k}) \approx E_{v0} - \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_h^*},
\]
the interband transition energy is
\[
\hbar\omega = E_g + \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_r^*},
\]
with reduced mass \( m_r^{-1}=m_e^{-1}+m_h^{-1}\).  
This joint dispersion governs emission linewidth and temperature dependence.

The joint density of states (JDOS) for 3D parabolic bands scales as \( \sqrt{E-E_g} \), so the spontaneous emission spectrum approximately follows
\[
I(E)\propto \sqrt{E-E_g}\,e^{-E/k_BT},
\]
producing thermal broadening and characteristic lineshapes observed in LEDs.

\subsection{Confinement: Heterostructures and Quantum Wells}

\subsubsection{Double Heterostructure LEDs}

The double heterostructure (DH), popularized in GaAs/AlGaAs devices, confines electrons and holes in a thin active layer with a smaller bandgap. This yields:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Higher carrier density} in the active region, increasing radiative recombination \(R_\mathrm{rad} = Bn^2\).
    \item \textbf{Reduced carrier leakage}, improving internal quantum efficiency (IQE).
    \item \textbf{Spatially overlapping wavefunctions}, enhancing optical transition strength.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Quantum Wells}

In quantum wells only nanometers thick, motion in the growth direction is quantized, producing discrete subbands.  
The 2D JDOS becomes "step-like", sharpening spectral features unless disorder broadening dominates.  
Confinement also introduces a blue shift:
\[
E_{e1}+E_{h1}\propto \frac{\hbar^2\pi^2}{2}\left(\frac{1}{m_e^*}+\frac{1}{m_h^*}\right)\frac{1}{L^2}.
\]

\subsection{InGaN Quantum Wells: Localization and High Efficiency}

Nakamura's Nobel Lecture \cite{nakamura_nobel} emphasizes a long-standing puzzle:  
InGaN LEDs remain highly efficient despite extremely high dislocation densities.

A widely accepted explanation is \textit{carrier localization} arising from compositional fluctuations (Indium-rich regions) in In\(_x\)Ga\(_{1-x}\)N alloys. These fluctuations create nanometer-scale potential minima that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Trap carriers or excitons, reducing diffusion to non-radiative dislocations.
    \item Create inhomogeneous broadening and Stokes shifts.
    \item Maintain high IQE even in imperfect crystals.
\end{itemize}

This mechanism underpins the remarkable performance of blue InGaN LEDs.

\subsection{Recombination Rates and Efficiency}

LED recombination dynamics are often captured by the
\[
R = A n + B n^2 + C n^3
\]
model, where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(A\): Shockley--Read--Hall (trap-assisted, non-radiative),
    \item \(B\): radiative band-to-band recombination,
    \item \(C\): Auger recombination (three-particle, non-radiative).
\end{itemize}

The internal quantum efficiency is:
\[
\mathrm{IQE} = \frac{Bn^2}{A n + B n^2 + C n^3}.
\]

At moderate carrier densities, the \(Bn^2\) term dominates, but at high density the \(C n^3\) Auger term causes \textit{efficiency drop}, observed especially in high-power GaN LEDs \cite{povey_aug2013, shen2007}.


\subsection{Polarization Fields in Wurtzite Nitrides}

GaN and InGaN materials possess strong spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization fields.  
In strained quantum wells these fields tilt the bands (quantum-confined Stark effect), leading to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Reduced electron-hole overlap (larger radiative lifetime).
    \item Red-shifted emission.
    \item Lower efficiency if fields are too strong.
\end{itemize}

Modern device design uses barrier engineering or semi-polar orientations to mitigate these internal fields.

\subsection{OLEDs: Molecular Picture}

Unlike crystalline semiconductors, organic emitters exhibit localized molecular orbitals. The HOMO-LUMO gap determines emission colour, and excitons dominate recombination:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Excitons can be singlet or triplet.
    \item Triplet harvesting via phosphorescent dopants or TADF increases efficiency.
    \item Transport is hopping-like rather than band-like.
\end{itemize}

Thus OLED physics is governed primarily by molecular electronic structure rather than extended band diagrams.

\subsection{Conclusion}

LED and OLED operation can be understood through a compact set of quantum-mechanical principles:  
band structures, density of states, quantum confinement, recombination kinetics, and disorder effects.  
InGaN localization and heterostructure engineering enable the high efficiencies that underpin modern solid-state lighting.



\section{Conclusion}

The objective of this lab was to characterize the LIV (Light--Current--Voltage) properties of LEDs of different colors and a red laser. Using a controlled current source and a photoreceiver, we measured the voltage--current characteristics and corresponding optical power outputs for each device. The maximum optical powers obtained were approximately $30 \,\mu\text{W}$ for the red LED, $32 \,\mu\text{W}$ for the amber LED, $34 \,\mu\text{W}$ for the green LED, and $85 \,\mu\text{W}$ for the blue LED. The laser reached about $53 \,\mu\text{W}$ at $I = 35 \,\text{mA}$, though with noticeable irregularities.  

Analysis of internal resistances revealed variations among devices. While most LEDs exhibited stable resistance values, the blue LED showed an apparent negative resistance, likely attributable to measurement error. In general, the LEDs demonstrated smoother and more predictable optical power scaling, whereas the laser displayed irregularities that may be linked to mode hopping or threshold effects. Among the LEDs, the blue device produced the highest optical output, consistent with its higher forward voltage requirement.  

The use of four-wire measurements proved advantageous, as they eliminated lead and contact resistances, resulting in more accurate voltage readings and lower calculated internal resistances.  

Limitations of the experiment include measurement noise, calibration uncertainties in the photoreceiver, and potential temperature effects on device performance. Future work could involve temperature-controlled measurements, improved detector calibration, and exploration of higher current ranges to investigate efficiency droop in LEDs more thoroughly.  

Overall, this lab provided valuable insights into the electrical and optical behavior of LEDs and lasers, highlighting both their performance characteristics and the importance of precise measurement techniques in optoelectronic device characterization.
